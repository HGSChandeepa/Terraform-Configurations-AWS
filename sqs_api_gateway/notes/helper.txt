    API Gateway Setup:

        Creates REST API with endpoints:

            /sms/normal

            /sms/priority

            /email/normal

            /email/priority

        Each endpoint maps to its corresponding SQS queue

        Uses IAM role for secure SQS access

    Message Flow:

        Client sends message to appropriate API endpoint

        API Gateway validates and forwards to correct SQS queue

        Consumer processes messages from queues

        After processing, consumer sends success notification to Processed-Notifications queue

    Webhook Notification:

        Lambda function triggers on new messages in Processed-Notifications queue

        Lambda sends HTTP POST to your webhook URL with message details

        Webhook URL is configurable via var.webhook_url
